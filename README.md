# Python Basics – Hands-on Practice

This repository is a **hands-on guide to basic Python programming concepts**, created as personal practice material.  
Each section demonstrates a **core Python concept** with **simple examples** and is **fully commented using `` (multi-line comments)** for clarity and learning purposes.

## **What’s Inside**

The code covers **step-by-step Python fundamentals**, including:

- **Data Types**: Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans  
- **String Operations**: Methods, concatenation, slicing, formatting  
- **Typecasting & User Input**  
- **Math Functions**: `math` module operations (`ceil`, `floor`, `sqrt`, `pow`)  
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else` with logical operators  
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, nested loops, loop controls (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)  
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries (CRUD operations)  
- **Functions**: Arguments, return values, `*args`, `**kwargs`, scope  
- **Random Module**: Shuffle, sample, random values  
- **Exception Handling**: `try-except-finally`  
- **File Handling**: Read, write, copy files using `with open` and `shutil`  
- **Basic OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Class creation, methods, instances
